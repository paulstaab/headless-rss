# Nextcloud News compatible API

headless-rss should provide an API that follows the Nextcloud News API specification so that clients
that support this API specification can use headless-rss as their backend service.

It should support both versions [1.2](https://github.com/nextcloud/news/blob/master/docs/api/api-v1-2.md)
and [1.3](https://github.com/nextcloud/news/blob/master/docs/api/api-v1-3.md) of the API spec.
