# headless-rss

A minimal-viable feed aggregator made for self-hosting.

`headless-rss` is an rss feed aggregator with a minimal feature set.
It is indended to be used in a homelab setting with a single user. It provides only
a Nextcloud News compatible API, but not webinterface, and can serve as a back-end
for compatible apps suchs as `NextNews` and `Fiery Feeds`.

If you are looking for a feature-complete feed aggregator back-end that supports e.g.
different protocals, multiple users or databases other than sqlite, please look at
