A minimal-viable feed aggregator made for self-hosting.

`headless-rss` is an rss feed aggregator with a minimal feature set.
It is indended to be used in a homelab setting with a single user. It provides
a [Nextcloud News compatible API](https://github.com/nextcloud/news/blob/master/docs/api/api-v1-3.md),

[Fiery Feeds](https://voidstern.net/fiery-feeds).

different protocols, multiple users or databases other than sqlite, please look at
